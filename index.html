      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a songwriter, record producer, performer. I deeply value sharing knowledge and I guest lecture to music industry students at James Madison University once a semester. I also mentor young artists, songwriters, and producers around Virginia. I worked for Apple for a few years as a technician, software trainer, and internal onboarding factilitator. I'm excited to start this new challenge of learning web development.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The music industry was hit pretty hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. While continuing to work with artists remotely, I decided that I needed to learn new skills to make a career transition and regain some stability. Since I love to create things, I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Codecademy and video courses on Udemy. I found that I really enjoyed working with code and that a lot of the skills I had developed in my previous career were applicable to programming and computational thinking. I'm excited to continue this new journey and see where it leads!</p>
